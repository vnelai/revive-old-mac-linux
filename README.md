# 🧠 Reviving an Old MacBook with Linux

This project documents how I repurposed an old MacBook Pro with macOS end-of-life issues into a fully functional Linux laptop using Ubuntu MATE. 
Along the way, I fixed a corrupted USB, handled unsupported Broadcom Wi-Fi drivers, and learned a lot about Linux kernel compatibility.

## 🔧 Project Goals

- Restore a non-working USB after a failed Balena Etcher flash
- Install Ubuntu MATE on end-of-life Mac hardware
- Fix Wi-Fi issues caused by Broadcom BCM4331
- Learn practical OS-level troubleshooting

## 📄 Contents

- `flash-recovery.md`: USB repair using macOS terminal
- `wifi-fix.md`: Resolving Broadcom Wi-Fi compatibility
- `hardware-notes.md`: Specs and OS issues of the MacBook
- `LICENSE`: MIT License

🛠️ Why this matters: This repo is proof that old machines still have value. Linux, some terminal commands, and persistence can turn end-of-life into a second life.
